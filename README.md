# Survey_paper
In this survey paper we discussed different multi label classification and its accuracy.

  1.Problem Transformation
  
    1.1 Label Powerset(LP)
    
    1.2 Binary Relevance
    
    1.3 Classifier Chains
    
  2.Adapted Algorithm
  
  3.Ensemble approaches
  
  
Conclusion:

  1.Problem transformation techniques and algorithm adaptation methods are the two basic approaches to solving a multi-label classification problem.
  
  2.The multi-label problem is transformed into a collection of binary classification problems, which may then be solved by single-class classifiers.
  
  
Future Work:

  1.The same problem can be solved using LSTMs in deep learning. 
  
  2.We could utilise decision trees for increased speed, and ensemble models for a suitable trade-off between speed and accuracy
